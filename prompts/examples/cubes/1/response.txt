To divide the cubes into two groups based on their color, according to their distribution, we will gather the red cubes in the left side of the image and the green cubes in the right side of the image. Here is the Python function to specify the final positions of the keypoints:

```python
def keypoint_specification():
    # Move red cubes to the left
    p1 = [-20, 0, 0]
    p3 = [-20, 0, 0]
    p4 = [-20, 0, 0]
    p7 = [-20, 0, 0]
    p9 = [-20, 0, 0]
    p12 = [-20, 0, 0]

    # Move green cubes to the right
    p2 = [20, 0, 0]
    p5 = [20, 0, 0]
    p6 = [20, 0, 0]
    p8 = [20, 0, 0]
    p10 = [20, 0, 0]
    p11 = [20, 0, 0]

    return p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, p12
```

This function will move the red cubes to the left side and the green cubes to the right side, effectively dividing them into two groups based on their color.
