Here is the Python function to specify the final positions of the keypoints:

```python
def keypoint_specification():
    p1 = p2 + [0, 0, 0]
    p3 = p2 + [0, 0, 0]
    p4 = p2 + [0, 0, 0]
    p5 = p2 + [0, 0, 0]
    p6 = p2 + [0, 0, 0]
    p7 = p2 + [0, 0, 0]
    
    return p1, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7
```

This will move all the keypoints of the coffee beans to the red position marked by P2.
