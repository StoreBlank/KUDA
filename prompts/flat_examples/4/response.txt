To move the green cubes to the red positions, we will align the keypoints of the green cubes (P3 and P4) to the positions of the red keypoints (P1 and P2). Here is the Python function to specify the final positions of the keypoints:

```python
def keypoint_specification():
    # Move green cube at P3 to the position of P1
    p3 = p1 + [0, 0, 0]
    
    # Move green cube at P4 to the position of P2
    p4 = p2 + [0, 0, 0]

    return p3, p4
```

This function will move the green cubes to the positions of the red keypoints, effectively completing the task.
