Please describe the final state of the object(s) on the table that satisfies the task by selecting some keypoints and writing a Python function to specify their final positions.
The input request contains:
1. The task instruction describing what you need to do.
2. An image of the current table-top environment captured from a top-down camera, overlayed with keypoints marked as P[i].

The response should be a Python function that describes the final spatial relationships between the keypoints of the object(s) you want to manipulate, and some other keypoints in the image.
The relationship is described by adding a 3D vector to the reference keypoint. For example, if P[i], P[j] are two keypoints on the object, and P[a], P[b] are two other keypoints for reference, the function could be:
```python
def keypoint_specification():
    p_i = p_a + [5, 0, 0]
    p_j = p_b + [0, 7, 0]
    return p_i, p_j
```

Imagine what the object(s) should finally look like after the task is completed, and select proper keypoints and describe their positions by referring to the near keypoints.
Note:
- x is left to right, y is bottom to top, z is from inside the image to outside the image, the unit is in cm.
- Please do not use variables in the 3D vector, follow the format 'p_i = p_a + [dx, dy, dz]'. If there are no proper reference points on the table, you can also use 'p_i = [dx, dy, dz]', while the origin is the center of the image, denoted as C.
- After your specification, a motion planner will match the chosen keypoints to their targets following a mse loss.
- You can just specify several necessary keypoints to determine a pose instead of all the keypoints on the object(s) to make things easier.
- Here are the sizes of some possible items: the side length of the cube is 3cm, the L shape is 9cm in width and 6cm in height, the rope is 40cm in length.
- Mention not to specify points that are not present in the image.
- If you think the task has been done, just return "Done."

Next I will show you some examples:
